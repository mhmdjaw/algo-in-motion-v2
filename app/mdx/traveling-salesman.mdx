**NOTES:**

- Cities cannot be dragged once the visualization begins. This is to prevent the distances
  between cities from changing while the visualizer is running.

- If both, number of cities and visualizer speed are set to max, the duration of the visualization
  takes at least `5:23` minutes to finish assuming your **FPS** can go higher than 120 (the FPS for
  this specific visualization is capped at 120, so it will never take less than that).

<Content title="Explanation">

The Traveling Salesman problem is described as a salesman who must travel `N` number of cities,
and the goal is to find the shortest possible route to visit each city exactly once.
The ordering of cities doesn't matter.

The problem is a famous **NP-hard** problem. Meaning There is no known polynomial time solution for it.

The **backtracking** technique generates all `N!` possible routes, calculates the cost of each route,
and keeps track of the current best route with the minimum cost. Since the algorithm goes through
all the different possibilities, the time complexity is an exponential `O(N!)`. That is the reason the
maximum number of cities in the visualizer is limited to 8.
