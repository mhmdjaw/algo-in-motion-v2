<Content title="Explanation">

Breadth First Search is a **graph traversing** algorithm. The goal of it is to visit
every node in the graph exactly once. The time complexity of BFS is `O(V+E)` where `V`
is the number of vertices (nodes) and `E` is the number of edges.
This is because the algorithm checks every vertex and edge once to determine if it was visited
or needs to be visited.

The algorithm follows a **breadthward** strategy. It covers the whole depth level of the current
vertex by checking all its neighbors, visiting the unvisited ones and adding them to the queue.
Once done, another vertex is dequeued and the same process is applied. The process is then repeated
starting from a random vertex until the queue becomes empty.
