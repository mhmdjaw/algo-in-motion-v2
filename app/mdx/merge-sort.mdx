<Content title="Explanation">

Just like Quick Sort, Merge Sort is a **Divide and Conquer** algorithm, and
one of its main competitors. The main difference is that unlike Quick Sort,
Merge Sort is **stable**, which means it has the same time complexity of `O(n*log(n))`
from its best to its worst case. This is the reason why in the worst case it performs better
than Quick Sort which has a time complexity of <code>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</code>. Although
in general, its performance is slightly worse because it makes more comparisons than
Quick Sort on average.

Merge Sort is based on the idea of dividing the list into two halves recursively until
there is only one element in each sublist. At this point, each leaf sublist is considered
to be sorted. After that we begin the process of merging back two sorted sublists at a time
until the main list is completely sorted.
