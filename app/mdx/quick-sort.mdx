<Content title="Explanation">

Quick Sort is a **Divide and Conquer** algorithm, which means the problem
is recursively divided into smaller problems until they are easy to solve.
The time complexity of quick sort is `O(n*log(n))` in the best and average
cases, and <code>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</code> in the worst case. However, on average it has the best
sorting performance which is the reason it's considered the **fastest**
sorting algorithm.

The algorithm first chooses a random pivot and places all elements with
values that are smaller than the pivot on the left and elements with
greater values than the pivot on the right. The process is then
repeated recursively on the left and right partitions until no
further partitioning can be made.
