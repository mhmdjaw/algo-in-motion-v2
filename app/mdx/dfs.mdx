<Content title="Explanation">

Like Breadth First Search, Depth First Search is also a **graph traversing** algorithm,
and has the same time complexity of `O(V+E)`. The technique however is the opposite of
BFS as the name states.

DFS, unlike BFS, follows a **depthward** strategy. Starting from a random vertex, it goes
as deep as possible from a vertex to another, each step moving immediately to the first
unvisited neighbor. Upon reaching a dead end (when all the neighbors of the current vertex are visited),
it starts backtracking one step at a time looking for another unvisited vertex and repeating the same
process going back and forth until it backtracks to the first vertex it started from.
