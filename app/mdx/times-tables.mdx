<Content title="Wondering What That is?">

**So what's really behind this captivating animation?**

What you're witnessing here is the artistic side of **mathematics**. This animation is not really driven
by a complex **algorithm**, but rather math. The concept behind it is quite intriguing, yet not so
complex and is what makes it so remarkable.

The concept is quite simple. Several points are equally spaced on a circle. Each point has an
index ranging from `0` to `N-1`. Each point connects with a straight line to another position
on the circle. That position is determined based on the point's index, multiplied by a certain
**factor**. For example, if the **factor** is `2`: point `1` connects to `2`, point `3` to `6`,
point `4` to `8`, and so on. If the destination position of the point exceeds `N`, the `modulo[%]`
operator is used to keep it within the boundary of available positions on the circle.

That's all there is to it! The animation is then created by varying the factor. Each frame represents
a different factor, starting from `0` and increasing by `0.01`. This results in a stunning and
endless animation. If you watch it long enough, you'll notice all sorts of crazy patterns
emerging. All it takes is straight lines shifting positions using basic math to produce this effect.
Just increase the number of points and the animation speed to max, and enjoy the wonders of math in motion.

**NOTE:** Be aware though that depending on the performance of your device, choosing a high number of points
may result in slower/skipped frames and the browser may not be able to paint at the speed chosen (FPS is
capped at 125 for this specific visualization at max speed).

**P.S:** The actual tricky part while building this was calculating the positions of points and destination
points using trigonometry. It brought up my school PTSD againüëç. Fun times!
