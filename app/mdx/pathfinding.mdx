<Content title="Explanation">

For the maze generation, there are quite a few available algorithms out there
(and they are all as fun to watch). In this particular visualizer, the **randomized
breadth-first** search is used. It keeps an array of all the current possible cells
the maze can currently expand into and randomly chooses one of them as long as the cell is
available (not a white cell yet).

A\* pathfinding is one of the most efficient pathfinding algorithms and the best
solution in many cases. You can find its uses in maps, games, and many other use cases.

The secret of its success is driven by its ability to cleverly search for the target
by using **heuristics**. Meaning it tries to guess the distance from the current cell
to the target. The guess is always underestimated assuming there are no obstacles on
the way. The current total cost is then calculated for the cell using the formula
`F = G + H` which is the core equation of the algorithm. `G` is the current cost from the
starting cell to the current cell, `H` is the estimated cost of the cell, and `F` is the
total cost. `H` is based on a formula we apply depending on the nature of the graph.
In the case of this maze, since it's basically a grid and we're only allowed to move
in four directions, we can use the Manhattan distance `H = | Xa - Xb | + | Ya - Yb |`
where `a` is the current cell and `b` is the target. Each step, we pick the cell with the
lowest `F`, expand into it, and calculate the `F` of its available children. The process
is then repeated until the target is found.
